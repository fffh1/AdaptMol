## Dataset

The dataset used in this work is available at: [data(link)](data_link_here)

## Pretrained Model

Download our pretrained model from: [model(link)](model_link_here)

## Installation

Create the conda environment using the provided configuration file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate adaptmol
```

## Usage

### Inference

Run prediction on molecular images:
```bash
python predict.py --model_path checkpoints_path --image_path image_path
```

### Training

Training consists of four stages. Run them sequentially:

**Stage 1:**
```bash
bash scripts/stage1.sh
```

**Stage 2:** Generate predictions on USPTO dataset
```bash
bash scripts/predict_uspto.sh
```

**Stage 3:**
```bash
bash scripts/stage2.sh
```

**Stage 4:**
```bash
bash scripts/stage3.sh
```
